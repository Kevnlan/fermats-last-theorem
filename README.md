# Fermat's Last Theorem Near Misses

This is a program that is produces near-misses of integer triplets that would satisfy a^n + b^n = c^n for some n > 2 where a is greater than 0, b is greater or equal to a and c is greater than b but less than 2^23

0 < x <= y < z < 223

## Setup Requirements

- Python 3
- Computer 


## Installation

clone git@github.com:Kevnlan/fermats-last-theorem.git

## Usage / How it works
It takes a number n which will be used as the exponent. It then generates 3 random numbers in the range 0-100 and produces the near misses
